            <p>Acidity is the only problem that interferes your daily activities. About 150 million people suffer from digestive diseases that ultimately give 
              birth to the acidity. The excessive formation of acid in the body gives rise to many other diseases.

              The wrong eating habits (eating excessive junk food, spicy food, processed food), sedentary lifestyle (not doing any activities like exercise, 
              playing games, sports, etc), prolonged sitting jobs is the major reason for acidity. Acidity is the acid reflux that leads to heartburn in the lower 
              chest when stomach acid flows back into the food pipe. When a person fell acid reflux for more than twice a week he/she is finally diagnosed with 
              Gastroesophageal reflux disease. People use to take antacids for a long period that causes side-effects on the body. So instead of that, you should 
              start with ayurvedic and herbal treatment.</p>
