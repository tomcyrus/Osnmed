            <h3 class="mb-4">What is the Ayurvedic View of Fistula?</h3>

            <p>A disease or condition causing severe referred pain to Bhag (perineum), and Guda (anal area), is called ‘’Bhagandar’’. According to Ayurveda, the manifestation begins with the boil (abscess) around the perianal region, if it is not treated properly it can burst and converts into a discharging tract known as Bhagandar.</p>

            <p>According to the Acharya Sushruta, when a person indulged in Mithya Aahar-vihar (un salutary lifestyle and food habits), Vata dosha in the body gets aggravated and localized in the anal canal. Further, it vitiates the muscle and blood, giving rise to Pitika (boil), and if this condition is not treated in time, the boil suppurates and burst resulting in a discharging track which leads to the formation of Bhagandar.</p>

                    <p>In Ayurveda, a special procedure is done to cure the fistula by Kshara Sutra. Chandigarh Ayurved Centre had performed this procedure by an experienced therapist under the guidance of an expert Doctors.</p>

                    <p>This procedure is done by specially seton thread medicated with organic alkalis such as Apamargakshara (Achyranthes aspera), Arkakshara (Calotropis gigantea) or Snuhikshara (Euphorbia lingularia). The alkali is repeatedly coated on the seton thread for about 15 – 21 times. We can also use natural antibiotics like Haridra powder, guggulu, etc to make Ksharasutra.
                    The chemical action of the drugs coated and mechanical action of the threads are collectively working of cutting, curetting, draining, and cleaning the fistulous track, thus promoting healing of the track/ wound. This procedure acts both as the antiseptic and fibrotic agent to induce healing. The mechanism of healing starts from deeper tissues and moves towards the periphery.</p>

                    <p>Kshara sutra is done under local anesthesia, the sutra is inserted into the tract and the two ends of the thread are tied forming a loop. The threads which are coated by alkali are continuously released throughout the length of the track thereby cutting, curetting, draining cleansing and healing the track. The therapeutic action of the thread lasts for seven days. After seven days, the old thread is then replaced with a new thread following the same procedure.</p>
